# Dialogflow Integration with Local MySQL Database

This project demonstrates a simple method to integrate Dialogflow with a local MySQL database without using Google Cloud services. The approach involves using a webhook to handle fulfillment and enabling secure HTTPS connections with ngrok. The entire solution is cost-free.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. **Setup Local MySQL Database:**
   - Install MySQL locally.
   - Create a database named `bookdb`.
   - Define a user with credentials (user: 'test', password: '1234').

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdalelah1/finalbot-with-mySqlAndNode.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run ngrok to Enable HTTPS:**
   - Download and install ngrok: [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
   - Run ngrok to expose your local server:
     ```bash
     ngrok http 3000
     ```
   - Note the generated HTTPS forwarding URL.

5. **Configure Webhook in Dialogflow:**
   - Open your Dialogflow agent.
   - Go to Fulfillment.
   - Enable the Webhook.
   - Set the URL to your ngrok HTTPS URL + '/webhook' (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/webhook`).

6. **Run the Local Server:**
   ```bash
   node your-server-file.js
   ```

7. **Test the Integration:**
   - In Dialogflow, simulate user queries.
   - The server logs and responds based on the MySQL database.

## Code Highlights:

- The Node.js server uses Express and the `dialogflow-fulfillment` library.
- MySQL queries are handled using the `mysql` library.
- ngrok is employed to create a secure HTTPS tunnel for the local server.
